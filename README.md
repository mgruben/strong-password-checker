# strong-password-checker
For LeetCode problem [#420](https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker/), determines the minimum number of changes needed to make a password strong.

## Background
In order to be "strong," a password must:  
1. be between 6 and 20 characters in length, inclusive,  
2. contain at least one lowercase letter,  
3. contain at least one uppercase letter.  
4. contain at least one number.  
5. not contain a sequence of 3 or more repeated characters

The possible single-action changes are:  
1. Delete a character,  
2. Insert a character,  
3. Replace a character with another character.

## Problem Statement
Given a password as a String `s`, return the **minimum** number of changes required to make `s` a strong password (0 if none).

## Motivation
This project was completed for [LeetCode - Problem 420](https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker/).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
