     * Given a String s, the candidate password, returns the minimum number
     * of single-action changes required for that password to be "strong".
     * 
     * In order to be "strong," a password must:
     * (1) be between 6 and 20 characters in length, inclusive,
     * (2) contain at least one lowercase letter,
     * (3) contain at least one uppercase letter.
     * (4) contain at least one number.
     * (5) not contain a sequence of 3 or more repeated characters
     * 
     * The possible single-action changes are:
     * (a) Delete a character,
     * (b) Insert a character,
     * (c) Replace a character with another character.
     * 
     * Ex. "abc12" -> 1 since the password is missing one character, and that
     *      character can be an uppercase letter.
     * 
     * Ex. "aaabbb" -> 2 since we can change the middle 'a' and 'b' to 'H' and '1'.
     * 
     * Ex. "Aa1Aa1Aa1Aa1Aa1Aa1zzAa1Aa1Aa1Aa1Aa1Aa1zzAa1Aa1Aa1Aa1Aa1Aa1zz" ->
     *      40, since the password meets the strong criteria except that it is
     *      60 characters long, so we must delete 40 characters.
     * 
     * Ex. "$$$$$$" -> 3, since it's missing lowercase, uppercase, and a number,
     *      and we can distribute those replacements to break the sequence of 6.
